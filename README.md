 Hi, I'm Owolabi Rasaq
I'm a researcher and PhD candidate in Civil Engineering with a strong background in Hydrogeology. My work focuses on the application of Earth Observation (EO), Remote Sensing, and Machine Learning for groundwater resources assessment, climate change impact analysis, and environmental monitoring, particularly within the Sokoto-Rima Catchment, Northwestern Nigeria.

üî¨ Research Interests:

Groundwater Modeling (MODFLOW, Groundwater Vistas)

Remote Sensing & GIS for Hydrology

Climate Data Analysis (CHIRPS, ERA5, GRACE, TerraClimate)

Environmental Sustainability & Water Resources Management

Python for Scientific Computing and Data Analysis

üìä Currently working on:

Groundwater recharge estimation using downscaled GRACE data

Machine Learning models for hydroclimatic trend analysis

Geospatial modeling of climate extremes and water stress

Tools & Technologies:

Languages: Python, R, MATLAB

GIS/Remote Sensing: QGIS, Google Earth Engine (GEE), ArcGIS

Hydrogeological Tools: MODFLOW, Groundwater Vistas, RockWorks

Data Science Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow

Climate & Earth Observation Data: CHIRPS, GRACE, ERA5, NASA POWER, TerraClimate

üåç Passionate about using data-driven solutions to address pressing environmental challenges in Africa ‚Äî from groundwater scarcity to climate change mitigation and sustainable development.
